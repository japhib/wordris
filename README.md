- Timer? If you don't choose a letter in 5 seconds, a random letter will get placed
- Pause
<!-- - Letter distribution -- Scrabble letter distribution is kinda whack -->
- Starting map
- How to get rid of letters that words don't end in? e.g. the bottom of the board just has V's and Z's. There aren't very many words that end in those letters.
    - You should be able to make words *up* as well as down
- More letters to choose from?
- Bigger board

Too many vowels/consonants in a row. They need to be nicely interspersed. It’s impossible to make words if you get 10 consonants

It’s too unstructured so far. There’s not really anything to solve, or a wider goal to go for.
Goals
- Use up X letters and clear the board as much as possible?
- Clear a pre-defined map? This could be puzzle mode with a re-do … if there’s more than one answer this could be bad though
- What about infinitely refilling maps, like in Candy Crush?

Items
- 4 letter words give you a pickaxe which you can drop on any letter and it’ll remove it.
- 5 letter words give you a bomb

Sal feedback 
- doesn’t clear until you tell it to, so you can make a bigger word 
    - Or at least let you choose, if there are multiple words found
